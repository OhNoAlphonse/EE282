# Final Project

Author: Kayla Raygoza


To understand how bacteria acquire resistance to phages, I compared the genomes of an ancestral Escherichia coli strain (IJO) to two resistant mutant strains (IJO_Large and IJO_small). 

## Methods
### Data used for bioinformatic project
Raw oxford nanopore and illumina reads were downloaded from Plasmidsaurus's website. 

### QC, Assembly and Genome annotation


### Genome Comparison


## Results
