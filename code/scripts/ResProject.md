Hello! I am trying my best.

So far, I have used Wget to get 3 E. coli genomes from the lab's google drive.
They are named ancestral.fasta, large.fasta, and small.fasta
The analysis will be done in code/scripts/ResProject_analysis.sh
The comparison will be done in code/scripts/ResProject_comparison.sh
The plots will be made in code/scripts/ResProject_Plots.sh

Once I figure out where I want to put the final outcome, I will link it here.
